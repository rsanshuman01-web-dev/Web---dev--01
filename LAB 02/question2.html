        <img src="https://wallpapercat.com/w/full/3/0/a/478138-1920x1080-desktop-1080p-spider-man-tobey-maguire-wallpaper-photo.jpg"
         alt="Spider Man" width="530" height="390">
        <p>This image shows Spider Man caught between two worlds - the red suit representing his heroic duty,
            and the black symbiote creeping in as a symbol of darkness and temptation. With the city behind him,
            the picture reflects his constant struggle to balance responsibility wit the weight of power. "WITH 
            GREAT POWER, COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY"
        </p>

        <p>This image shows Wolverine standing tall in his classic yellow suit, a symbol of his unbreakable spirit and raw strength.
            With his sharp claws and fearless gaze, Wolverine represents resilience, endurance, and the struggle of a man torn between
            his human heart and his animal instict.

       <p>This image shows Deadpool, the unfiltered and unpredictable anti-hero known for his dark humor, quick reflexes, 
        and unmatched fighting skills. Unlike traditional superheroes, Deadpool breaks the rules, often mocking both his enemies
        and himself, making him a symbol of chaos and comedy.
